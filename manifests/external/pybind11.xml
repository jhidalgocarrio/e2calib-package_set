    <description brief="Pybind11: Seamless operability between C++11 and Python">
        pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in
        Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++
        code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent Boost.Python
        library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional
        extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time
        introspection.
